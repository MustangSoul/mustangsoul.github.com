Image life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air.You name them--<font color="blue">work,family,health,friends and spirit</font>,and you're keeping all these balls in the air.

***

You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball.If you drop it,it will bounce back.but the other four balls are made of glass.if you drop one of these,it will be irrevocably scuffed,marked,nicked,damaged or even shattered.They will never be the same.<font color="blue">You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.

***

How?

Don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others.It is because we are different that each of us is special.<font color="red">Don't set your goals by what other people deem important.Only you know what is best for you</font>
